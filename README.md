# security-trends-project

My personal interest project for COMP6441 20T1 (Security Engineering & Cyber Security) at UNSW Sydney.

Abstract from my project report:
As part of the ‘Something Awesome’ security project for COMP6441, I undertook an investigation into historical cyber security related events and carried out some data analytics to determine and predict trends in the occurrence of these events. The aim was to forecast the occurrence of future security events and provide some meaningful conclusions to inform future security research. 

This report outlines the process of sourcing and analysing data for my investigation and the trends that I found, as well as some discussion on the benefits and negatives of using data science in cyber security.
